A game designed upon the theme, you are your own enemy for Counterspell 2024 (HackClub).

## Game Concept
A unique twist on classic survival mechanics - instead of avoiding traps and seeking safety, this game flips the traditional formula on its head! Here, as the player, your job is to aim for the spikes and your "saviors" are actually your greatest threat. If they catch up to you - you lose! If you manage to get trapped by a trap - you win!

## Gameplay Mechanics
- Strategic Spike Usage: Spikes randomly appear and disappear throughout the world. 
- Tactical Survival: Lure the "savers" into the spikes to eliminate them. 

## Key Features
- Dynamic spawning system for spikes and savers
- Screen-wrapped movement for seamless navigation
- Time-based scoring system
- Local leaderboard to track best survival times
- Unique "anti-rescue" gameplay mechanic

## Technical Details
- Built using Python and Pygame
